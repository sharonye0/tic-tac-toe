# Todo List

1. Add two modes for playing, Vs Ai and Vs A Friend. (DONE)
2. Split these two modes. (DONE)
3. In the Friend mode take the names on both players (or generate a random name).
4. In the AI mode let the computer choose a move randomly (then I'll implement the minimax algorithm).
5. The Win or Tie alert should be in a fixed position in the "src/components/computerBoard.tsx"
6.
